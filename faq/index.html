                	<h3>Who should apply for Democracy Summer?</h3>
                    <p>Democracy Summer is ideal for students interested in a career in public service, politics, a non-profit field or community-based work. All students enrolled in NC colleges and universities are eligible to apply. Because student organizers are responsible for covering their own housing, most participants apply to work in cities where they have family or other living arrangements available. The ideal applicant will have:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>A passion for social and economic justice</li>
                    <li>An ability to communicate with diverse groups of people</li>
                    <li>An interest in and general understanding of politics</li>
                    <li>Strong public speaking skills</li>
                    <li>An ability to work independently and as part of a team</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>When does the program start? When does it end?</h3>
                    <p>For 2015, the program begins with a 3-day orientation in Durham on May 27-29. The first work day is June 1st, the last is July 31st. See the <a href="http://www.democracysummer.com#dates" title="Key Dates">Key Dates</a> section for more.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What does the program include?</h3>
                    <p>The 10-week internship includes:</p>                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>A mandatory 3-day orientation retreat</li>
                        <li>10 weeks of boots-on-the-ground direct action organizing</li>
                        <li>A mid-point retreat</li>
                        <li>Additional training opportunities via Democracy North Carolina</li>
                        <li>A mandatory Presentation of Learning at the end of the program </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Will I be expected to travel?</h3>                    
                    <p>There may be some travel involved so interns will need a reliable means of transportation. Democracy NC will reimburse participants for travel. </p>
                    
                    <h3>How will we be paid?</h3>
                    <p>Interns will be paid $2,500 over the 10 week program (through Democracy NC’s payroll system---direct deposit is available)</p>
                    
                    <h3>Can I apply for more than one internship position?</h3>                    
                    <p>We encourage applicants to choose whether or not you are applying for one of the opportunities---Organizing, Communications or Research based on your interest and skill set. Applying for more than one slot will not increase your chances of selection and may in fact undermine your possible selection. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Can I apply for more than one Organizing location (e.g. I attend school in Charlotte, but am from Rocky Mount)?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, but please indicate your preference and why. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Does Democracy North Carolina provide housing for the program?</h3>
                    <p>No. Interns will be expected to secure their own housing for the summer. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Will I be working for a political party?</h3>
                    <p>No, Democracy North Carolina is a non-partisan 501c3 organization. We do not engage in partisan politics, but rather electoral politics. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Can I have a job or attend summer school while I participate in Democracy Summer?</h3>
                    <p>No, as stated previously, the Democracy Summer program is a full-time paid experience that requires 40+ hours a week (some work on weekends and evenings are to be expected). </p>
                    
                    <h3>I can't fill out the online application. Is there any other way to apply?</h3>

                    <p><strong>Student Organizer:</strong> As an organizing intern, you will work focus on placed-based direct action organizing in teams of two under the supervision of one of our highly skilled and experienced community organizers. Organizing teams will work in local communities in Asheville, Charlotte, Fayetteville, Rocky Mount or Winston-Salem to empower local volunteers, advocate for policies that improve democracy, and understand how to navigate North Carolina’s power structure and political process.</p>
